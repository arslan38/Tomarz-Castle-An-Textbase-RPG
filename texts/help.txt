In this game you are free to where you want to go.
You should use numbers to pick which option you want.
There are 3 main stats in game. Health,damage coefficent and diplomatic.
Damage coefficent times damage range of weapon is your final damage.
You can convince enemies if you have enough diplo stat to do not fight but you can't get any loot for this fight.
You can not die while playing but if your health goes to zero you will lose money and your progress.
While playing the game, you have to discover for yourself how to earn money or which way to go. Write your own story.
Every time you change location, the game is saved and starts from where you last left off. 
If you want to close the game just close the window but do not forget to change location before closing.
