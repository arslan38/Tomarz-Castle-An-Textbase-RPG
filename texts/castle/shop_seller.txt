I only went out a few times \nthis castle is my whole life.I love this simple life.Even though the people \nhere don\'t have a lot of money, they are not poor.The villages are said to be \nvery poor.They had even more difficulty with the things that shouted and dressed \nlike animals that came by the Red Forest. Thats all I can say now. \n>You should visit the shop more often {player.name}.
