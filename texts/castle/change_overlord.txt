0-1-1-0-0-0-0-You entered the his room \n\nHe saw you and got up and came towards you.\n\n>It's nice to see you {player.name}. You went to the red forest, as I understand from the fact that you have not been around for a long time and you suddenly came to me. Did you kill that monster?\n-Say 'Yes, I went there and talked to the commander.'&1-Say 'I need to tell you something. They think I came here to kill you.'&9
1-1-1-0-0-0-0-Apparently you couldn't kill him. What do you mean I talked to him? Did he know that you are my man?\n-Say 'Yes, I met with them as your ambassador and they told me some things about you.'&2-Say 'No, I infiltrated and found out all their stays and their plans.'&3
2-1-1-0-0-0-0-The Lord watched you with doubtful eyes.\n\n>what happened? Are you looking a little strange? What did that rebel say to you?\n-Say 'He said you are a cruel.'&5-Say 'I'm doing fine. Shall I tell you about the geography of the region and the camp site?'&3-Say 'I need to tell you something. They think I came here to kill you.'&9
3-1-1-0-0-0-0->Well come on and tell me the plans at my desk.\n\nYou made your way to the table. You reached for your dagger and got ready.\n -Kill him&4 -Say 'I need to tell you something. They think I came here to kill you.'&9
4-1-0-0-0-0-8-You unsheathed your dagger and plunged it into the heart of the overlord sitting at his table. He gave you a look of disappointment.\n\n>You were my son....\n\nYou quickly left the room. You didn't want to go near those rebels, nor stop at the castle. You saved the people from a murderer, but you shot the man who fed you for years in the back. You've been in seclusion for life. 
5-1-1-0-0-0-8->Noticing his hateful gaze, the lo<rd realized that something was wrong.Suddenly, he shouted to his guards at the door and made a move towards the sword behind him.\n-Attack him&6-Kill guards and run away.&7
6-1-0-0-0-0-8-You attacked the lord with your unsheathed dagger. Jumping on him, the lord grabbed his sword and turned it towards you. All of a sudden you saw blood coming from the lord's mouth. You plunged your dagger right into his chest.\n\nAfterwards, you felt a warmth in your stomach. The lord's sword had entered his abdomen and exited his back. You both died there. Neither the guards who came to the room, why the people of the castle could not figure out why this happened. After receiving the news, the rebels set out from the red forest and the villagers revolted.\n\nA council was formed representing the peasants and a new ruler was elected. You brought a different order to the land. 
7-1-0-0-0-0-8-You quickly cut the throat of the guard trying to enter the room with your dagger and started running towards the castle exit. You could hear the lord's shouts behind you and the soldiers running. You jumped on one of the horses that were standing by the door.\n\nWhen you threw yourself out of the castle gate, you realized you had nowhere to go. You didn't know what the rebels would do to you when they found out you didn't kill the lord. You never had a chance to return to the castle. You couldn't even see the innkeeper's beautiful daughter anymore.\n\nYou rode towards the mountain village. You came to a high cliff. You dismounted and set the horse free. It was his turn to set himself free. You jumped off the high cliff and were free forever.

9-1-0-0-0-0-8->I know you're too loyal a guard to be deceived. Let's plan a raid with you.\n\nYou sat at the lord's table and made a detailed plan. The next night, you destroyed the rebels in a sudden raid. To honor you, the lord asked you to kill the commander of the rebels. You broke the commander's smile of disappointment and pain with a sword stroke.\n\nThe Lord has sent you to do more of his dirty work. You were collecting taxes from the villagers and beating those who did not. You were kidnapping young girls and handing them over to the lord. You were executing deserters. In short, you became the lord's dog.
