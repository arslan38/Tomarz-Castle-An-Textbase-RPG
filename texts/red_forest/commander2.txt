1-1-1-0-0-0-2->What are you talking about? These clothes leaked here? \n\nIt does not matter anymore. Tell me, what did the bastard Remo say?\n -Say 'You can't talk about him like that. Be carefull on your words.'&3-Say 'It gives you the chance to surrender, destroying their village and harassing their people, making yourself look like a monster and establishing a horror empire. If he enters here with his army, you have no chance.'&4
2-1-1-0-0-0-2-The commander walked towards you suspiciously. \n\n>What will you give me, comrade?\n -Quickly grab the sword of the soldier next to you and lunge towards him.\n&5-Say 'I'm a guard from Tomarz Castle. And I have a few messages for you.'&1
3-1-1-0-0-0-2->>Or what do you do? Are you trying to kill me in my tent, next to my soldiers?-Say yes if necessary and make a move with your gun towards him.\n&5-Say 'No, I came here to tell you that you need to stop your torture.'&4
4-1-1-0-0-0-2->It is that bastard Remo who is monster and oppresses the villagers. Do you think we came down from the sky? We used to live in those villages, too. Some of us were about to die of hunger, while unspeakable things were done to some of us.\n-Say 'You could have gone and reported this to the lord. Maybe his men aren't giving him enough information. Is that enough to revolt?'&8-Say 'If so, why are you stealing the crops of those villagers and attacking them?'&9
5-1-1-0-0-0-2->You handled your gun and made a move. Noticing this early, the commander met your attack and snatched his weapon from his hand. He put his gun to your neck.\n\n>What will you do now, guard?\n-Shout 'Monsters!'&4-Beg for your life.&6
6-1-1-0-0-0-2->If you switch sides and go over to us, I'll spare your life or I will kill you now. Your first mission will be to go and kill that bastard Remo.\n-Shout 'No way,kill me!'&7-Say 'Okay, spare my life, I'll go and kill it.'&10
7-1-0-0-died,0-0-quit->Then there is no need to prolong it.\n\nHe unsheathed his great sword and effortlessly smashed your head from your body in one swift motion.
8-1-1-0-0-0-0->While you were living a comfortable life in the castle, we were working there for you. Don't you think it's enough to starve to death, to have your woman and daughter raped, to have your little boy go to war and die to protect a land that isn't even yours?\n-Say 'Are you doing something very different when you raid villages and kill villagers?'&9
9-1-1-0-0-0-0->We're taking those supplies to live here and save them. We did not touch a single villager's property unless we had to. Those villagers you call dead are the people who make up my army now. We don't kill anyone unless necessary.\n\nAfter telling all this, the commander suddenly looked at a distant point and his attention is no longer on you.\n-Say 'How? How does Lord Remo do these?How could he be so vicious? He has deceived me all these years.'&11-While he is pensive, make a move with your weapon and try to kill him.&12
10-1-0-0-poison,0-0-quit->Then I will give a poison to you.And if you don't kill the bastard Remo within 2 days, the poison will kill you. Now go.
11-1-1-0-0-0-0-The commander approached you. \n\n>Remo used our bodies and I see he also use your ideas and beliefs. He took care of those valuable (!) guards who did not leave the castle. Because without them, why should the villagers be afraid to come to the castle and kill him, right? You, lad, have come all this way so that the lord can sit in his comfortable chair. You risked your life. Is it worth it?\n-Say 'If I had known all this, it wouldn't have been worth it.'&13-Cut the neck of the approaching commander with your dagger.&12
12-1-0-0-war,0-0-17->Taking advantage of your absentmindedness, you drew the small dagger from your waist and jumped into the neck of the commander in one move and cut it. The warm blood of the commander was smeared on him. You grappled with his closeup bodyguard, who lunged towards you, and he couldn't get away. You cut off the commander's head and took it in your hand and went out of the tent.\n\nYou shouted, >'Your commander is dead now, obey Remo'. 
13-1-1-0-0-0-2->Come be with us. Go to your commander as usual and sneak him dead. Rescue innocent villagers and children. If that happens, I will disband this army and we will go back to our villages. We want this more than anything.\n-Say 'I will do it.'&14-Say 'No, I can't. I am loyal to him.'&10
14-1-0-0-poison,0-0-quit->I will not trust a spy like you. Bring the poison and drink it in this pooch. Go and kill the lord. Or you will die from this poison. If you kill and come back, I'll reconsider the idea of giving you an antidote.
15-1-1-0-0-0-0->You entered the commander's tent. He was talking to some soldiers. He turned towards you and asked the soldiers who had brought you.\n\n>What's going on? Who is this?\n -Say 'I'm a guard from Tomarz Castle. And I have a few messages for you.'&1-Say 'I have something special thing to give you, commander.'&2
16-1-1-poison,0-0-0-15-If you don't want to die, don't linger any longer.-Go Back&19
