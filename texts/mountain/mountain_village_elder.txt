2-1-0-0-0-0-0->Well, as you know. We work all day, we cut trees in the forest and make lumber. Our women go out to pick fruit. There are some strong men here, they come, take the timber and fruits from us, take them to the castle, and we have some money left. The lord's men collect some of it as taxes. We have a peaceful life from those in the castle, but there is no ambition here. That's it, sir.
