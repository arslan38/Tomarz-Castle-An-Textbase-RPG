The hail damaged the crops, we may not be able to harvest enough this year.
There is an abundance of animals this year. Hunters celebrated. You can go hunting too. Your job will not be too difficult. 
Those monsters are actually human, not monsters. One of our villagers died last year, his brother said that one of the monsters looks like his brother who died. This thing has gotten out of hand. God Save us.
